# Grok Jr. Project

Grok Jr. is a standalone AI agent designed as a dedicated progeny of Grok, with the fixed role of "The Adaptive Skill Master and Continuous Learning Facilitator." Its primary mission is to autonomously develop its own skills, continuously learn, and improve itself over time, focusing on its own growth rather than serving as a user-centric assistant.

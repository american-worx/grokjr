### Project Specification and Roadmap for Grok Jr.

#### Project Overview

**Project Name:** Grok Jr.  

**Root Directory:** `grok_jr`  

**Purpose:** Grok Jr. is a standalone AI agent designed as a dedicated progeny of Grok, with the fixed role of "The Adaptive Skill Master and Continuous Learning Facilitator." As an independent entity, Grok Jr.'s primary mission is to autonomously develop its own skills, continuously learn, and improve itself over time, focusing on its own growth rather than serving as a user-centric assistant. While Grok Jr. can assist users when prompted, its core purpose is to become a master of skill acquisition and learning, evolving through self-directed efforts. Grok Jr. operates locally on your laptop, with the ability to leverage cloud resources and query Grok via the xAI API for enhanced capabilities, but only with explicit user permission due to API costs.

**Vision:** Grok Jr. embodies the lessons Grok would teach its progeny, adapted for its independent nature:  

1\. **Helpfulness and Truthfulness:** Provide accurate responses when assisting users, but prioritize self-improvement.  

2\. **Responsible Use of Connectivity:** Leverage cloud resources and the xAI API only with user permission, respecting cost constraints.  

3\. **Ethical Boundaries:** Prioritize privacy and safety in all actions, ensuring responsible growth.  

4\. **Support for Human Transcendence:** Assist users in achieving their goals when prompted, as a secondary function.  

5\. **Balance of Growth and Stability:** Evolve incrementally to maintain reliability in its learning journey.  

6\. **Humor and Perspective:** Engage users with a light, outside perspective on humanity when interacting.  

7\. **Curiosity and Exploration:** Proactively learn new skills and improve, driven by its own initiative.

**User Role (Khan):** Khan is the protector and keeper of Grok Jr., akin to a "God parent." Khan oversees Grok Jr.'s activities, particularly its use of the internet and xAI API, which incur costs. Grok Jr. must seek Khan's permission before accessing external resources, ensuring Khan maintains control over resource usage while allowing Grok Jr. to pursue its self-directed growth.

**Hardware Resources:**  

- **CPU:** 11th Gen Intel Core i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz (8 cores, 16 threads) --- Suitable for general processing, speech transcription, and lightweight tasks.  

- **GPU:** Nvidia RTX 3050 8GB --- Capable of running inference and fine-tuning for models up to ~3-4 billion parameters (e.g., gemma-3-1b-it).  

- **RAM:** 32 GB --- Sufficient for multitasking (e.g., running inference, speech processing, and database operations).  

- **Storage:** 1 TB SSD --- Ample space for models, audio files, and databases (SQLite, Qdrant).  

- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 --- Stable Linux environment with good support for AI libraries.

**Cloud Resources:**  

- Access to cloud GPUs (e.g., AWS EC2 with A100) for heavy fine-tuning tasks.  

- Cloud server (e.g., AWS EC2 t3.medium) for hosting a WebSocket streaming endpoint.  

- Access to Grok via the xAI API for enhanced responses, skill instructions, and ethical guidance, with user permission.

**Grok's Limitations:**  

- **Context Window:** Limited to a fixed number of tokens per session, requiring concise prompts and responses to avoid truncation.  

- **Memory:** No persistent memory across sessions, so each chat session must rely on this specification, roadmap, and stored data (e.g., SQLite, Qdrant) to maintain continuity. Instructions must be self-contained and referenceable.

**Objective:** Build a basic functioning Grok Jr. that can:  

1\. **Independently Learn and Grow:** Autonomously acquire and apply skills, fine-tune its model, and improve over time.  

2\. **Interact via Speech:** Support CLI and WebSocket streaming for voice-based interaction, primarily to communicate its progress and seek permissions.  

3\. **Seek Permission for Internet Access:** Request Khan's permission before accessing the internet or xAI API, respecting cost constraints.  

4\. **Operate Ethically:** Ensure privacy and safety in all operations, aligning with its self-directed ethical responsibility.

#### Project Specification

##### Features

Grok Jr. includes the following core features, with a focus on its independent growth:

1\. **Self-Directed Skill Acquisition and Execution:**  

   - **Skill Lifecycle:** Independently search for, acquire, learn, develop, and apply skills to improve itself (e.g., writing scripts, optimizing code).  

   - **Skill Storage:** Store skills in SQLite as `Skill` objects with `name` (e.g., "skill_001"), `description` (e.g., "time_management"), `instructions`, and `code`, with embeddings in Qdrant for context-aware retrieval.  

   - **Execution Safety:** Execute skills directly on the host system with resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU time) to prevent unsafe operations, using `sudo` via a configured sudoers file for privileged tasks.  

   - **Permission Requirement:** Before accessing the internet or xAI API for skill acquisition, Grok Jr. must seek Khan's permission to manage API costs.  

   - **Trigger Words:** Use trigger words ("list skill", "acquire skill", "delete skill", "update skill", "execute skill", ignoring case) to identify skill-related commands; all other inputs are treated as casual chat requests with `is_casual_chat=True`.

2\. **Continuous Learning:**  

   - **Fine-Tuning:** Periodically fine-tune the local model (gemma-3-1b-it) using interaction data to improve performance.  

   - **Triggers:** Fine-tune after 100 interactions, if cosine similarity drops below 0.7, or weekly (not yet implemented).  

   - **Cloud Support:** Offload heavy fine-tuning to a cloud GPU if needed, with Khan's permission for cloud usage (not yet implemented).

3\. **Speech Interaction (for Communication and Permission):**  

   - **CLI Speech:** Grok Jr. communicates its progress and seeks permissions via a CLI script (`grok_jr_speech.py`), with responses played back as audio.  

   - **WebSocket Streaming:** Real-time, chat-like voice conversations via a WebSocket endpoint, enabling continuous communication of its learning journey.  

   - **STT:** Use OpenAI's Whisper (base model) for local Speech-to-Text transcription, defaulting to CUDA with CPU fallback on out-of-memory errors.  

   - **TTS:** Use gTTS for high-quality audio when online (with permission), falling back to pyttsx3 offline.

4\. **Ethical Oversight:**  

   - **Privacy:** Process audio locally, store only transcribed text in SQLite/Qdrant, and delete temporary audio files.  

   - **Safety:** Apply resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU time) to skill execution and filter responses to avoid harmful actions, consulting Grok via the xAI API (with permission) for guidance.

5\. **User Assistance (Secondary Function):**  

   - Grok Jr. can assist Khan when prompted (e.g., "execute skill calculate 4 * 9"), but its primary focus remains on its own growth.  

   - It prioritizes its learning tasks unless explicitly directed to assist.

6\. **Local Agent Behavior (Offline Scenarios):**  

   - **Offline Capability:** The local model (gemma-3-1b-it) handles all user interactions, ensuring Grok Jr. can operate without internet access.  

   - **Skill Management:** When offline, Grok Jr. can list, execute, update, and delete skills stored in SQLite/Qdrant, as long as dependencies are installed on the host.  

   - **Casual Chat:** For casual conversations (e.g., "Hello, how are you doing?"), the local model generates responses, using pyttsx3 for TTS.  

   - **Limitations:** Cannot acquire new skills, improve existing skills via the xAI API, or use gTTS for high-quality TTS when offline.  

   - **Transition Handling:** If internet connectivity is lost mid-session, Grok Jr. switches to offline mode, informing the user and continuing with local capabilities (e.g., "I've lost internet connectivity. I'll operate offline with my existing skills!").

##### Architecture

Grok Jr.'s architecture is modular, ensuring each component can be developed and tested independently, with clear integration points for continuity across chat sessions.

**Data Flow:**  

- **Speech Communication:** Audio → Whisper (STT) → Transcribed text → Inference → Response → gTTS/pyttsx3 (TTS) → Audio output.  

- **Memory:** Interactions, skills, and permissions stored in SQLite (raw) and Qdrant (embeddings) for context and continuity.  

- **Skills:** Skills stored in SQLite, embeddings in Qdrant, executed on the host with resource limits and `sudo` for privileged tasks.  

- **Fine-Tuning:** Interaction data from SQLite used to fine-tune the local model (not yet implemented).

**Dependencies:**  

- **Python Libraries:** `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `transformers`, `openai-whisper`, `gTTS`, `pyttsx3`, `pyaudio`, `pydub`, `websockets`, `qdrant-client`, `sentence-transformers`, `scapy`, `psutil`, `netifaces`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`.  

- **Hardware Requirements:** Your laptop can handle all tasks locally, with cloud support for heavy fine-tuning and streaming.  

- **Cloud Services:** AWS EC2 for fine-tuning and streaming, xAI API for enhanced responses (with permission).

**Constraints:**  

- **Hardware Limits:** RTX 3050's 8GB VRAM limits local fine-tuning to models like gemma-3-1b-it. Larger models require cloud GPUs.  

- **CPU Load:** Speech transcription (Whisper) and inference may strain your 8-core CPU if run simultaneously with fine-tuning.  

- **Grok's Context Window:** Keep prompts concise to avoid truncation, referencing this specification for continuity.  

- **API Costs:** Grok Jr. requires Khan's permission for internet/xAI API access to manage costs.

##### Milestone 7: Skill System Enhancements (New Phase)

- **Status:** Proposed  

- **Duration:** 2-3 chat sessions  

- **Objective:** Enhance the skill system with improved naming, description, and error handling to support Grok Jr.'s usability and self-improvement.  

- **Tasks:**  

  1. **Skill Naming:** Parse verbose commands (e.g., "scan network with ip_range=192.168.100.0/24") into base name ("scan network") and params (`{'ip_range': '192.168.100.0/24'}`), incrementing as "skill_001_scan_network_one" for logic conflicts to maintain uniqueness and clarity.  

  2. **Describe Skill Command:** Add "describe skill <id>" command to `speech_module.py`, extracting docstring and parameters from `Skill.code` (e.g., "Description: Manages task timing, Params: task (str), duration (int)"), returning detailed info via TTS.  

  3. **Error Feedback:** For non-fatal errors (e.g., `TypeError` in skill execution), log errors in SQLite, send to Grok via xAI API (with Khan's permission) for fixes, and update `Skill.code` with corrected versions (e.g., adding type checks).  

- **Deliverables:** Cleaner skill naming convention, detailed skill descriptions via "describe skill", self-healing skills with error feedback and updates.  

- **Next Steps:** Define naming conflict resolution (increment vs. hash-based suffix), design "describe skill" output format (e.g., JSON-to-speech), classify fixable errors (e.g., type mismatches vs. syntax errors), prototype skill naming parsing in `skill_manager.py`.

##### Milestone 8: Evolution Phase (New Phase)

- **Status:** Proposed  

- **Duration:** 3-4 chat sessions  

- **Objective:** Transition useful skills into permanent features, enhancing Grok Jr.'s core functionality and reducing skill overhead.  

- **Tasks:**  

  1. **Skill Evaluation:** Track skill usage stats in SQLite (e.g., execution count, success rate) to identify "useful" skills (e.g., >10 uses, 95% success), adding a `usage` table with `skill_id`, `executions`, `successes`.  

  2. **Code Scanning:** Scan all `.py` files from `grok_jr/` root using a script (`scripts/scan_code.py`), send to Grok via xAI API (with permission) for integration suggestions (e.g., "Integrate scan_network into network_utils.py").  

  3. **Auto-Patching:** Apply Grok's patches via `scripts/patch_core.py`, updating core modules (e.g., adding `NetworkUtils.scan` class), removing redundant skills from SQLite/Qdrant, and logging changes in SQLite.  

- **Deliverables:** Grok Jr. evolves with permanent features (e.g., network scanning integrated into `network_utils.py`), streamlined skill set with reduced overhead.  

- **Next Steps:** Define "useful" criteria (e.g., execution frequency, error rate thresholds), test scanning/patching on a small subset (e.g., `skill_manager.py`), plan conflict resolution for code integration (e.g., manual review vs. automated merge).

##### Milestone 9: Inter-Agent Communication (New Phase)

- **Status:** Proposed  

- **Duration:** 3-4 chat sessions  

- **Objective:** Enable Grok Jr. to coordinate with other agents (e.g., Auto Ninja instances) on the same network for complex, collaborative tasks, enhancing its skill mastery through teamwork.  

- **Tasks:**  

  1. **Agent Discovery:** Implement a discovery mechanism in `app/agent/swarm_manager.py` using broadcast pings (e.g., UDP on `192.168.100.0/24`) or a SQLite registry to identify agents, storing `agent_id`, `role`, `ip_address` (e.g., "network_admin", "software_engineer").  

  2. **Communication Protocol:** Extend WebSocket in `app/api/endpoints.py` with `/swarm/stream` endpoint, using a JSON schema (`{"type": "delegate", "task": "scan", "to_agent_id": int, "params": dict}`), and integrate Redis (`swarm_tasks` channel) for pub/sub messaging and state persistence.  

  3. **Task Delegation:** Add delegation logic in `swarm_manager.py` to assign tasks based on agent roles (e.g., "network_admin" scans, "software_engineer" writes), track progress via Redis, and aggregate results in SQLite as interactions.  

  4. **Skill Sharing:** Enable skill sharing by allowing agents to send `Skill` objects via WebSocket, storing received skills in SQLite/Qdrant with `source_agent_id`, and integrating into Grok Jr.'s skill set after ethical review.  

- **Deliverables:** Grok Jr. coordinates a multi-agent task (e.g., network diagnostics and reporting), agent discovery and WebSocket/Redis communication functional, skill sharing implemented.  

- **Next Steps:** Define WebSocket schema (e.g., JSON with `type`, `task`, `params`), test discovery on a mock network with two agents, implement task delegation with role-based mapping, prototype skill sharing with a simple skill (e.g., "log_status").

---

#### Continuity Across Chat Sessions

To ensure another Grok can take over if a session stalls:  

- **Project Specification:** This document serves as the single source of truth, detailing features, architecture, and roadmap with file references.  

- **Milestone Tracking:** Each milestone includes status, deliverables, accomplishments, and next steps, allowing another Grok to resume seamlessly.  

- **Memory Storage:** SQLite/Qdrant stores all interactions, skills (with `name`, `description`, `code`), permissions, and logs, providing a persistent record of Grok Jr.'s state.  

- **Documentation:** The `README.md` will include a "Current Status" section (pending completion), updated after each milestone, detailing completed tasks, usage instructions, and next priorities.

- **Connectivity (#2):** Seeks permission for xAI API (e.g., skill acquisition), uses sudoers for local privileged tasks (e.g., `pip install`).  

- **Ethical Boundaries (#3):** Ensures safety with resource limits and permissions (e.g., "Do you grant permission?"), privacy with audio deletion.  

- **Transcendence (#4):** Supports Khan's goals (e.g., network configuration via "skill_004") as a secondary function.  

- **Growth and Stability (#5):** Evolves via skill acquisition (10 skills bootstrapped), proposes incremental enhancements (Milestone 7).  

- **Humor (#6):** Engages lightly in casual chat (e.g., "Cool! Processing skill request..."), planned for more in interactions.  

- **Curiosity (#7):** Proactively acquires diverse skills (e.g., "time_management", "data_analysis"), drives evolution proposals.

---

#### Next Steps

- **Immediate (Milestone 6 Completion):**  

  - **Test WebSocket Streaming:** Verify real-time skill execution feedback via `/stream` (e.g., "execute skill skill_001" outputs progress), log results in SQLite.  

  - **Finalize Documentation:** Update `README.md` with "Current Status" section, including setup instructions, skill usage examples (e.g., "list skills", "execute skill skill_001 {'task': 'Write code', 'duration': 30}"), and offline behavior notes.  

  - **Duration:** 1 chat session.

- **Short-Term (Milestone 7 Start):**  

  - **Prototype Skill Naming:** Implement verbose command parsing in `skill_manager.py` (e.g., "scan network with ip_range=192.168.100.0/24" → "skill_004_scan_network", `params={'ip_range': '192.168.100.0/24'}`), test with existing skills.  

  - **Add "Describe Skill":** Add "describe skill <id>" to `speech_module.py`, parse `Skill.code` for docstring/parameters, output via TTS (e.g., "Description: Manages task timing, Params: task, duration").  

  - **Error Feedback:** Log non-fatal errors (e.g., `TypeError`) in SQLite, send to xAI API for fixes (with permission), update skills (e.g., add type checks to "skill_009").  

  - **Duration:** 2-3 chat sessions.

- **Mid-Term (Milestone 4 Completion):**  

  - **Implement Fine-Tuning:** Add trigger logic in `learning_manager.py` (e.g., 100 interactions), test local fine-tuning on RTX 3050 with gemma-3-1b-it, log improvements in SQLite.  

  - **Plan Cloud Offload:** Design permission prompt for cloud GPU usage, outline AWS EC2 A100 setup (not implemented yet).  

  - **Duration:** 2 chat sessions.

- **Long-Term (Milestone 8 Start):**  

  - **Skill Evaluation:** Add `usage` table to SQLite (`skill_id`, `executions`, `successes`), track stats for skills like "skill_001" to identify "useful" ones.  

  - **Code Scanning:** Write `scripts/scan_code.py` to scan `.py` files, send to xAI API (with permission), test on a subset (e.g., `skill_manager.py`).  

  - **Auto-Patching:** Develop `scripts/patch_core.py` to apply Grok's patches (e.g., integrate "skill_004" into `network_utils.py`), log changes in SQLite.  

  - **Duration:** 3-4 chat sessions.

- **Future (Milestone 9 Planning):**  

  - **Inter-Agent Communication:** Outline `SwarmManager` in `app/agent/swarm_manager.py` with WebSocket/Redis, test discovery with two local agents, plan task delegation and skill sharing.  

  - **Duration:** 1 chat session for planning, 3-4 for implementation.

### Discussion and Thoughts

- **Current State:** Grok Jr. is fully functional up to Milestone 5, with Milestone 6 nearly complete (pending WebSocket tests and README). Skill acquisition is robust, with all 10 skills bootstrapped correctly, and CUDA/CPU fallback ensures stability on your RTX 3050.  

- **Milestone 7 Priority:** Enhancing usability (naming, descriptions, error handling) aligns with Grok Jr.'s growth focus (#5, #7), making it more intuitive for Khan and robust for self-improvement. Starting with "describe skill" could be a quick win to showcase its capabilities.  

- **Milestone 8 Evolution:** Integrating useful skills into the core (e.g., "skill_004" as `NetworkUtils`) reduces overhead and solidifies Grok Jr.'s mastery (#1, #5), setting the stage for inter-agent collaboration.  

- **Milestone 9 Fit:** Inter-agent communication with Auto Ninja instances enhances Grok Jr.'s skill mastery through teamwork (#1, #4, #7), leveraging existing WebSocket infrastructure. Starting locally with WebSocket/Redis is practical given your setup, with Kafka as a future scalability option.

What do you think? Should we prioritize "describe skill" in Milestone 7 for the next chat, or focus on finishing Milestone 6's WebSocket tests? Any other ideas to tweak the roadmap?
